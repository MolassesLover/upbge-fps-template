This is a completely free and open-source template for the
[UPBGE](https://github.com/UPBGE/upbge) game engine, a 
community-driven revival of the old Blender game engine 
(BGE).

# Usage
Simply load up the [`FPS_Template.blend`](src/FPS_Template.blend) file
it contains all the data to kickstart your first-person game. The
**Player** and **Player Camera** objects use the logic brick system,
you may want to check it out. Additionally, the **Player** object
uses the **Player Movement** component.

# Learning
If you are new to the UPBGE game engine, check out the official
UPBGE [manual](https://upbge.org/#/documentation/docs/latest/manual/index.html),
and [documentation](https://upbge.org/#/documentation/docs/latest/api/index.html).
